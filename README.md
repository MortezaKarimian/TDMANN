# TDMANN
Time Distributed Memory Augmented Neural Networks 


Time Distributed Memory Augmented Neural Network framework that benefits from NTM and DNC in the binary classification of brain activities in EEG signals. 



**Experiment Environment**
To run the experiments, a hardware system with CPU specifications Intel Core i5 9500 and RAM 8GB and graphics card ASUS Phoenix GeForce GTX 1050 with 768 CUDA cores and the ability to support TENSORFLOW-GPU have been used. The software platform includes Windows 10 operating system, Anaconda environment, and Python 3.6 coding language. Also, the libraries used include TENSORFLOW, version 1.15.2, and KERAS library, version 2.2.4. The below figure, describes the specifications of the experimental environment. It should be noted that the reason for the difference in some hyperparameters is because of the difference in the form of input data, it is necessary to fit the input tensor of the model accordingly. Among these, it can mention the difference number of channels (3, 22, 64) in the datasets. Also, the sampling rate is 250 Hz and 160 Hz for different datasets.
